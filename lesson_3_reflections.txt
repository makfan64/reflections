When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repositories allow other users to collaborate with you.
    Remote repositories also provide a form of backup for important code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Every time you pull changes, you may have to merge. If the merge
    requires manual action, then it could delay the work you are doing
    locally. 

    Also, when I am working on a significant local change, I often
    don't want to update from the master/remote very often. If
    something breaks, then I don't know if I caused the problem or
    something I picked up from the remote caused the problem.
